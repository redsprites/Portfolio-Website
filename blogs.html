    <h2><a href="#">Lost</a></h2>
   
    <p>
      ...This part is perhaps not related to the assignment. Spending hours at the library struggling to
      write the analysis for part II, I decided to take a break and went down the rabbit hole of trying to
      figure out why I hate writing so much, which spiraled into questioning my life's purpose (not the
      first time, lol). I was questioning if I was doing it wrong or if there is a better way to write. I
      believe I have some creative ideas, but why do other people love to write and not me? With a
      dead end after a couple of Google searches, I thought maybe there is something out there that I
      can resonate with, an idea I can write about and perhaps that makes writing less dreadful.
      Scrolling through my phone, I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNHmxIqKuA&t=312s">video</a> by David Whyte. And though it's not what the
      assignment asked for, I decided to write about it because I feel like in this class there is the
      freedom to break some rules, be a little creative, and maybe be genuine.
      The Video talks about this poem:
    </p>
      <h4>Lost  </h4>
      <i>by David Wagoner</i>
      <pre>
        Stand still. 
        The trees ahead and bushes beside you Are not lost. 
        Wherever you are is called Here,
        And you must treat it as a powerful stranger,
        Must ask permission to know it and be known.
        The forest breathes. Listen. It answers,
        I have made this place around you.
        If you leave it, you may come back again, saying Here.
        No two trees are the same to Raven.
        No two branches are the same to Wren.
        If what a tree or a bush does is lost on you,
        You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows
        Where you are. You must let it find you
      </pre>

        <p>     “This is a piece by David Wagoner, who was the chair of poetry at the University of Washington.
          The poem is about a teaching story from the Northwest Indian tradition. It is a story that would
          be told to a young boy or girl who would ask the question, ‘What do I do when I'm lost in the
          forest?’ This was a life or death question in the climax cedar forest of the Northwest. Trees 150
          feet high, you walk into them just 100 yards and you can't see any of the four cardinal directions,
          so you need to know how you know where you are.”
        </p><p> 
          I resonated with this piece because I often feel lost. Maybe it's a typical thing in your 20s, but I
          feel like there should be some sort of path, a direction, or certainty to happiness or purpose for
          life. Perhaps because of moving to a new country that has different people and cultural values,
          or maybe because of me changing my beliefs and views about the world as I grew up, I feel a
          huge deal of uncertainty and self-doubt. 
        </p>
         <p>In this piece, David Whyte says, “How do you know that
          you are doing something radical? Because you can't see where you're going. Everything you
          have leaned on for your identity has gone, and so you are going to enter the black
          contemplative splendors of self-doubt at the same time as you are setting out on this new path.”
          </p><p>
          This gave me some sort of hope that I am paving my own way, an opportunity, and freedom to
          be creative and lay my own path instead of going on a predetermined one. But now the question
          becomes, how would I embrace these feelings of doubt while creating my own path?
          </p><p>
          The first thing mentioned is that you cannot sleepwalk your way into your destiny. You must
          wake up and pay attention. When it says, “Stand still. The trees ahead and bushes beside you
          are not lost,” that means paying attention to the things around me, my thoughts, and things I do
          every day. It means not being so eager to go to some imagined future that I don’t see the things
          around me. He also mentions that wherever you are is called here. I understood it to mean to be
          present in the moment, giving my whole self to where I am and what I do now, no matter how
          small, even though I have bigger ambitions. This helps me to have an open mind to whatever
          comes my way.
          </p><p>
          The second part is something that I had to sit thinking about for a while. And maybe I will
          understand it better in the future. But what I took it to mean was that for the things I pay
          attention to flourish, I need a feeling of silence or the ability to silence the mind from a hundred
          reasons it gives me not to make any real change.
          </p><p>
          And lastly, it says, “the forest knows where you are; you must let it find you.” I believe it means
          not saying I know, I am the master, I am the expert to the world around me, instead to be
          humble and say I don’t know to everything then the world becomes my teacher so I can learn
          from every moment, every thing, every feeling, every thought.

    <h2><a href="#">When you are washing the dishes ...</a></h2>
    
    <p>
        "Thich Nhat Hanh once said, 'When you're washing the dishes, that action should be the center of your universe. 
        Just like when you're sipping tea, make that moment the axis on which your world turns.' 
        I often find myself tangled up in thoughts about the future — will I land a job? Will I secure a work visa after college? 
        Or I get lost reminiscing about past regrets. My mind is always on a trip, either to an uncertain future or a long-gone past, 
        leaving me anxious or downcast. </p>

        <p> I stumbled upon this while listening to Tim Ferriss's podcast: 
        'Be there when you're washing the dishes because if you're already dreaming about enjoying some peaches later,
         you'll miss out on the present moment. And guess what? When you're finally eating those peaches, your mind will already be somewhere else.
         ' It's like a cycle of constant yearning, and before you know it, you've missed out on actually living.
         </p> <p></p>
        So, the lesson here? Be present. Savor the now. Because, at the end of the day, this very moment is all we really have.</p>
